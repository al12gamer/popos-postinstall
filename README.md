# popos-postinstall
Post-install scripts for software that I've used in [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/) for work in the past.
This assumes you'll be installing Pop!_OS on a desktop and not something [requiring a custom kernel like a Chromebook.](https://eupnea-linux.github.io/)

# Quick Start
```
git clone https://github.com/al12gamer/popos-postinstall.git
cd popos-postinstall
chmod +x pop-postinstall.sh
./pop-postinstall.sh
```
