# popos-postinstall
Post-install scripts for software that I've used in [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/) for work in the past.
This assumes you'll be installing Pop!_OS on a desktop, System76 laptop or Framework laptop. I mainly use AMD cards with this so I've included radeontop and the like.

# Quick Start
Open a Terminal and paste each of the following lines one at a time, hitting enter after pasting each.
```
git clone https://github.com/al12gamer/popos-postinstall.git
cd popos-postinstall
chmod +x pop-postinstall.sh
./pop-postinstall.sh
```
